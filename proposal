1.Project title
Imbanlanced Binary Classification

2.Data set 
train_numeric.csv - the training set numeric features (this file contains the 'Response' variable)
test_numeric.csv - the test set numeric features (you must predict the 'Response' for these Ids)
train_categorical.csv - the training set categorical features
test_categorical.csv - the test set categorical features
train_date.csv - the training set date features
test_date.csv - the test set date features

3. Project Idea
Imbalanced Data: upsampling, downsampling, SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
Thousands of features: dimension reduction, especially for categorical data
xgboost: defined own objective

4.Software
Pandas dataframe, xgboost, scikit-learn
Missing value processing, data preprocessing, grid search

5. Papers to read
Chawla, Nitesh V., et al. "SMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique." Journal of artificial intelligence research 16 (2002): 321-357.
Tianqi Chen, Carlos Guestrin, "XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System." 2016, KDD

6.Work division
Data preprocessing and dimension reduction
Sampling methods: upsampling, downsampling and SMOTE
Xgboost, neural network and other classifiers
Cross Validation, grid search and machine learning pipeline

7. Midterm milestone
After dimension reduction, Fit data in a single machine
Test several sampling methods
Build simple machine learning pipeline and submit the result of test data in Kaggle
